      <description>Text Editor:  Why?: Text editor is a program that developers use to create and edit a range of programming language files. We&amp;rsquo;ll be using Atom, because it&amp;rsquo;s open source (free) and really good.
 Download Atom
  Browser:  Why?: Google chrome is a robust browser with a variety of tools that are helpful to developers.
 Install Google Chrome
  Github:  Why?: Github (and Git) are tools/applications used to by developers to manage their code and work collaboratively with each other.</description>

      <description>Recommended Folder Organization  Create a folder in your Documents folder (My Documents on Windows) called jsd
 At beginning of every class, you&amp;rsquo;ll use git (this process will be explained in the next class) to download any starter files to your jsd folder are available for that day&amp;rsquo;s lesson
 As the course progresses you&amp;rsquo;ll have a neatly organized listing of all of your work that looks similar to this:</description>
